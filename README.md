## Project Description
The goal behind this project is to gradually learn game development. Rouge like game project is, like the name already says, a simple 2D rogue like where the player has to go through rooms of enemies to win the game. The game has been made with C# and Raylib-cs. 

This project was not ment to be a real finished game that could be published. Although it is working and playable it has many logical issues, unfinished assets/methods and things that could be approved on. It is not necessairly a bad thing because to learn you have to make some mistakes and later improve on those mistakes. This is my first bigger game project that I finished. You are welcome to play the game, go through the code and don't be afraid to leave feedback! That would be much appreciated!
